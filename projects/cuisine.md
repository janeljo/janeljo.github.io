summary: "My group developed a web application to connect college students to simple recipes."
---

My group's web application, [College Cuisine Connect](https://collegecuisineconnect.site/) aims to address the unique culinary needs of college students. The system provides a centralized platform that curates a diverse range of recipes tailored to the specific needs and constraints of college life. Recognizing that many students may have limited access to a fully equipped kitchen or face time constraints, College Cuisine Connect emphasizes recipes that are not only nutritious but also quick, budget-friendly, and easy to execute.

Through a user-friendly interface, students can explore a variety of recipes, ranging from simple microwave-based meals to those requiring minimal cooking equipment. The platform also takes into consideration dietary preferences, allergies, and restrictions to ensure inclusivity and accommodate diverse needs within the UH community.

For this project, I worked with a wonderful group of classmates to form the ["ES6 Enthusiasts"](https://es6-enthusiasts.github.io/) based on our shared love for coding standards. We developed a team contract, organized a meeting schedule, and utilized issue-driven project management practices to collaborate effectively. This was the first group project I had ever done in a computer science class that involved coding, and I found the whole experience to be extremely fun and rewarding. 

You can learn more at our [project Github page](https://es6-enthusiasts.github.io/CollegeCuisineConnect/). Special thanks to Loelle, Bill, Juliette, and Kyla for being such a delight to collaborate with!
