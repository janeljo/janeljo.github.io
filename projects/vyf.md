[Visualizing Your Future](https://visualizing-your-future.github.io/) is a web application developed for [Spire Hawaii LLP](https://www.spirehi.com/) to help clients visualize financial projections based on their input data. Designed to meet the needs of an accounting and advisory firm, the app provides an intuitive platform where clients can enter budgets, view profit & loss statements, and analyze data through interactive, impactful charts and tables.

As part of Team 1 in the Fall 2024 Software Engineering II (ICS 414) course, I collaborated with eight classmates to design, build, and present this application over a 16-week period. We used GitHub’s Issue-Driven Project Management (IDPM) methodology with milestone boards and rigorous code reviews to ensure quality and progress. I contributed to developing core features of the platform, performed peer code reviews, and worked directly with client feedback to refine the design and functionality.

Key achievements:
  - Implemented input and visualization components using React and Meteor.
  - Delivered user-friendly interfaces for budget, P&L, and client dashboards.
  - Coordinated development through milestones and client presentations.
  - Ensured accessibility and maintainability of code via consistent reviews.
  - Deployed locally with guidance on developer setup for Meteor-based apps.

This project emphasized real-world teamwork with unfamiliar teammates, close client interaction, and the importance of collaborative, review-driven development processes — skills I continue to carry forward.
