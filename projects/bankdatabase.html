<p>This was a part of project that I worked on for my ICS 212 course during the Fall 2022 semester, which had us coding in C and later C++. We were tasked with creating a user-interface and database to manage customer bank records. Between the two, the database part ended up being more challenging to me because of our heavy use of pointers. I often found myself having to pull out a piece of paper to visualize the database’s records. And I learned to be very careful about what I was accessing and modifying. Though it might have caused a few headaches at one point, I think that this project really strengthened my understanding of pointers, which made the rest of the semester much easier.</p>

<p>The experience of programming in C felt quite laborous at times, especially with the Vi text editor. This <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html">basic Vi commands cheat sheet</a> saved me a lot of time and I was referencing it constantly. Honestly, I don’t think that I’ll ever want to return to a text editor, but it definitely made me appreciate the ease of use that most IDE’s provide.</p>

<p>Here is my database part of the project:</p>
