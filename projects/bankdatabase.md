This was a project that I worked on for my ICS 212 course during the Fall 2022 semester. The experience of programming in C felt quite laborous at times, especially with the Vi text editor.  

I think that the biggest benefit of this project was solidifying my understanding of pointers, which we had to work with a lot throughout the course. 

Here is part of the project I had written in C:
