As part of my role with the Hawai‘i Undergraduate Initiative (HUI) — a program supporting first-generation and incoming UH Mānoa freshmen — I was tasked with improving the program’s public-facing website hosted under the Office of Multicultural Student Services.

The existing site used an outdated, cluttered template that was difficult to navigate and visually unappealing. I rebuilt the site from scratch with a clean, accessible layout, using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques to improve both aesthetics and usability. The refreshed design better highlights HUI’s mission, programs, and resources, while also making it easier for students to find application information, contact details, and event updates.

This project not only supported outreach and increased program visibility but also sparked my deeper interest in web development and user-centered design.
