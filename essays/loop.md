## Back in my day

When I was still a wee elementary student, I got involved in my school’s FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics program. We constructed our robots out of Lego parts and programmed them using simple block coding — it was real cute. I remember the satisfaction of watching our robot’s wheels spin and traverse the classroom floor. It was like finally being able to gaze upon a finished puzzle after hours of putting all the pieces together. Ever since that early exposure to programming, I knew that I wanted to work in tech. 

## Endless possibilities await 

Years later, after 3 more subsequent robotics teams, taking AP Computer Science in high school, and a few computer science courses at UH Manoa, I was still determined to keep working *with* computers, I didn’t really know what I wanted to work *on*. I’ve been stuck in a loop of waiting for some epiphany where I’ll know exactly what I want to do with a computer science degree to no avail. Once you learn the fundamentals of programming, there are infinitely many ways to apply them and the choices have overwhelmed me. I have both an appreciation and a resentment of the flexibility of this field. But I hope that by exploring all of these different applications of software engineering, I’ll be able to find a niche that I’m passionate about.

## For now

I’ve been pretty interested in web/app development, mainly because it’s what I have the most exposure to as a user. It’s amazing how we can be convinced to spend hours and hours scrolling through an app or clicking through a website. My goal isn’t necessarily to entrap others into becoming chronically online, but rather to continue finding the small ways to improve our day-to-day lives.
