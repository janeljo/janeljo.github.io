<h2 id="back-in-my-day">Back in my day</h2>

<p>When I was still a wee elementary student, I got involved in my school’s FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics program. We constructed our robots out of LEGO parts and programmed them using simple block coding — it was really cute. I remember the satisfaction of watching our robot’s wheels traverse the classroom floor and feeling like I had outdone all of NASA’s space rovers. Ever since that early exposure to programming, I knew that I wanted to work in tech.</p>

<h2 id="endless-possibilities-await">Endless possibilities await</h2>

<p>Years later, after 3 more subsequent robotics teams, taking AP Computer Science in high school, and a few computer science courses at UH Manoa, I was still determined to keep working <em>with</em> computers, I just didn’t really know what I wanted to work <em>on</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve been stuck in a loop of waiting for some epiphany where I’ll know exactly what I want to do with a computer science degree to no avail. Once you learn the fundamentals of programming, there are infinitely many ways to apply them and the choices have overwhelmed me. I have both an appreciation and a resentment of the flexibility of this field. But I hope that by exploring all of these different applications of software engineering, I’ll be able to find a niche that I’m passionate about.</p>

<h2 id="for-now">For now</h2>

<p>While I’m not looking to commit myself to anything in particular, I’ve been pretty interested in exploring web and app development, mainly because it’s what I have the most exposure to as a user. It’s amazing how we can be convinced to spend hours and hours scrolling through an app or clicking through a website. My goal isn’t necessarily to entrap others into becoming chronically online, but rather to continue finding the small ways to improve our day-to-day lives.</p>

<p>Currently, my main goal is to improve myself as a programmer – writing more efficiently, having a deep understanding of what each part of my code does and why it’s the best choice for the job, etc. And with the skills that I attain from that journey, I want to apply my knowledge to more specific projects and see what I’m capable of.</p>
