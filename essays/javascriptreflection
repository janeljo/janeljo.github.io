In the brief time since my introduction to the wonderful creation that is Javascript, I’ve come to the conclusion that Javascript and I are going to be very good friends. Compared to the other programming languages in my repertoire, there’s an aspect of flexibility with this programming language that I find extremely refreshing and fun to experiment with. Notably, after becoming so used to the way other languages treat classes, Javascript’s first-class functions feel a bit like cheating and it’s still taking some time for me to adjust. 

My feelings towards the concept of athletic software engineering are quite identical to how I feel about typical exercise — I dread it but I know it will be good for me in the long-run. When I was struggling in my calculus class, I used a similar method of picking out practice problems and trying to finish them within an allotted time period to prepare myself for the timed exams. But I don’t think that I would have even thought to apply this method of studying to a computer science class. Admittedly, programming has always been more of a “sit, stare at the screen, and throw everything at your code until something sticks” experience for me. And while it wasn’t efficient, it worked — which is not a sentiment I want to carry into this semester.

I realized just how crucial efficiency was during the first WOD. Unsurprisingly, I experienced a bit of test anxiety and found myself having to retype words that I mispelled or forgetting basic syntax, despite having been able to do these things correctly during practice WODs. This has only encouraged me to practice and challenge myself more, and learn to be more confident in my decisions as a programmer. 

Though I expect to undergo some aches and pains, I’m looking forward to seeing a better version of myself by the end of it.
