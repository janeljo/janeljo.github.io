<p><em>‘This… stuff’? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you.” – The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</em></p>

<p>Though fashion trends may come and go, the basics of making clothes have withstood the test of time. We can look back to the past century and see both the historical roots and the enduring influence of styles shaping our attire today. While some may venture into the challenge of freehand design and measurements, many skilled clothes makers still utilize patterns as a foundation for structure and reliability. And from this structured base, creativity unfolds. Just as a well-crafted dress pattern can be adapted to create diverse styles, software design patterns offer a framework that accommodates changes and enhancements without compromising the integrity of the codebase. Fashion and software engineering may seem to exist in different circles, but the use of these design patterns — in clothing and coding — make way for innovation on the runways and world wide web alike.</p>

<h2 id="pattern-parallels">Pattern Parallels</h2>
<p>The Factory design pattern entails creating objects without exposing the underlying logic, potentially returning objects associated with different classes, and/or creating dependent objects. We can think of this pattern as an haute couture designer, crafting custom garments for the fashion collectors who want to own a one-of-a-kind piece of clothing. Its exclusivity is highly-valued and sought after, so rather than buying a standard, mass-produced product. This pattern, like a bespoke creation, emphasizes attention to detail and customization.</p>

<p>The Singleton design pattern provides a “global variable” in an object oriented language that does not support global variables and/or provide complex global state. This is similar to renowned fashion houses creating signature pieces like the distinctive Louis Vuitton handbags, Burberry scarves, and Gucci belts. In the same vein, the Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists, serving as the cornerstone of the codebase.  Much like a globally recognized item in fashion, the Singleton simplifies access to shared resources, maintaining cohesion across the application.
The Observer pattern is used when a set of objects need to be informed whenever a change in state occurs to another object. To ensure that their showcase has a desired effect and influence on their audience, a runway show choreographer must be extremely aware of and willing to adapt to the changing trends for maximum appeal. Just as a runway look may be altered before a model walks, the Observer pattern ensures changes resonate seamlessly across the entire code ensemble.</p>

<p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is desirable to decouple the internal representation of information from the way it is presented to and accepted from the user in a user interface — The Model encapsulates data and logic, the View manages presentation, and the Controller orchestrates interactions. Like the collaborative effort of fashion designers, models, and stylists, the MVC pattern fosters an organized and effective approach to software engineering. It separates concerns, allowing for flexibility in adapting to changing requirements—a true embodiment of code elegance.</p>

<p>So, whether donning the latest fashion or navigating some cutting-edge software, the reliance on patterns persists. In both realms, the use of patterns not only upholds tradition but also serves as a springboard for creativity, ensuring that the creations, whether worn or executed in code, stand as a harmonious blend of timeless foundations and contemporary expression.</p>
